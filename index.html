        <h2>Who is the biggest polluter? </h2>

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <h3>Depends how you ask</h3>
        <p>Who is to blame for the dangerously high levels of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in our atmosphere? The answer depends on which perspective you take. If you look at total emissions, you’ll see the same big players: the United States and China. But switch to per capita emissions, and the story changes— UAE takes the lead, while China and India fall far behind.</p>
        <p>And it’s not just about the numbers. There’s money involved, too. Developing nations argue that wealthier countries, which have been burning fossil fuels for centuries to build their economies, should bear the financial burden of transitioning the world to greener energy. Yet, rich countries have fallen short of their promises to deliver on this "climate finance" and help mitigate climate change’s growing damage.</p>
        <p>As negotiations at COP26 have shown, this debate—who should pay, and who is to blame—is far from settled. So, let’s explore how the title of "biggest polluter" shifts depending on which question you ask.</p>

        <!-- Graph 1: Historical Emissions -->
        <h3>1. Who has polluted the most over time?</h3>
        <p>When we examine historical emissions, going back to the Industrial Revolution, it becomes clear that the United States is responsible for the largest share of CO₂ released into the atmosphere. Since 1751, the U.S. has accounted for around 25% of all cumulative CO₂ emissions. This places it far ahead of China, whose emissions, although now the largest annually, add up to only half of the U.S. total.
Europe, driven by the UK’s early industrialization, was also a significant early contributor. The UK was the world’s biggest emitter until 1888, when it was surpassed by the U.S. Asia’s role in historical emissions is smaller, as its industrial rise has taken place primarily in the last few decades.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>2. Who emits the most CO₂ today?</h3>
        <p>In terms of current annual emissions, China is the clear leader, responsible for 28% of global CO₂ emissions as of 2020. North America contributes 18%, with most of that coming from the United States. India, now the third-largest emitter, accounts for 7% of global emissions. Asia as a whole is responsible for more than half of the world's emissions, primarily due to the rapid industrialization and large populations in China and India.</p>
        <!-- Graph 3: Per Capita Emissions -->
       
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/19504822">

        </div>
 <h3>3. Who has the highest emissions per person?</h3>
<p>
When we shift the focus to per capita emissions, the story changes. Small, oil-rich nations like Qatar and Kuwait top the list, with Qatar emitting over 40 tonnes of CO₂ per person each year. In contrast, the United States, while still relatively high, ranks 13th, emitting around 16 tonnes per person. China drops significantly in this ranking, coming in at 41st, with India much lower at 131st due to its large population and lower industrialization per capita.</p>

        <!-- Graph 5: Emissions by Income Group and Additional Visualizations -->
        <h3>4. CO₂ emissions by income group</h3>
        <p>The disparity in CO₂ emissions between income groups is striking. High-income countries emit significantly more CO₂ per person—up to 30 times more than low-income countries. In a fair world, each group’s emissions share would match its population share, but that's not the case. High- and upper-middle-income countries, making up less than half of the global population, account for over 80% of emissions. In contrast, lower-middle and low-income countries, home to the other half, emit less than 20%, with the poorest countries contributing less than 1%.</p>

        <!-- Graph 6: CO₂ Emissions and Economic Growth -->
        <h3>5. CO₂ emissions and economic growth</h3>
        <p>One of the most significant drivers of CO₂ emissions is economic growth. As countries develop, their GDP per capita increases, often leading to a corresponding rise in CO₂ emissions. This is because wealthier nations tend to consume more energy and resources. However, some regions have managed to decouple economic growth from emissions, such as certain European countries, which have reduced their CO₂ output while still maintaining strong economies.</p>
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/19506429">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>

        </div>

        <p>So, who is the biggest polluter? It depends. If we look at historical emissions, the United States is the clear leader. If we focus on current emissions, China takes the top spot. But if we shift to per capita emissions, the answer becomes even more complex, with smaller, wealthier nations taking the lead. As climate change discussions evolve, the debate over responsibility will only intensify—and it’s clear that every country will need to play a part in reducing the global carbon footprint.</p>
